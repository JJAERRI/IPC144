1. a=4 / a=3
Explanation : The first result is that since a was declared a postfix 'a++' before it was used in the printf statement, a=4 comes out when printed.
The second result is 3 before a++ is calculated because it is declared a=3 first and printed out in printf statements as it is.

2. The value price1 is not being converted as intended because we used a float variable. Due to the limits of floating point representation, '24.96' might not be represented as intended in the float type because it uses 32 bits to represent a floating point with limited accuracy. With the use of double variables, the remaining values are more accurate floating-point representations. The values should convert as intended because the double type uses 64 bits.

3. In the first example, an implicit transform occurs in which the result of integer division of money/100 is automatically transformed into a double via %lf format specifier. In the second example, a coercion occurs in which an integer division resulting from division between two integers is forcibly transformed into an integer via %d format specifier. In the third example, the transform is applied explicitly on (double)money, and the %lf format specifier is used to report the division results in double form. In the fourth example, %d format specifier is used to explicitly convert the double result after division into an integer, with the decimal places trimmed.
