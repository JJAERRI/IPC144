1. I don't have any programming experience, so everything related to coding is quite new to me. As for the C programming and the course, I've heard that C is a just computer language, often used for system programming. I'm wonder to see how it compares to other computer languages.

2. The compiling process involves translating C code that I write into machine code that the computer can understand and execute. This transformation from a C text file to an executable program seems like a important step in the programming. Therefore, compiling is really important in C programming.

3. I'm hoping this course will teach me a lot of things. I didn't know much about C programming until I took this course, but after I completed this course, I want to become someone who knows a lot about C. Also, I want you to know what code I write and how to solve problems. I expect this course challenging for me, but I think it will be rewarding and helping me to develop problem solving skills.
